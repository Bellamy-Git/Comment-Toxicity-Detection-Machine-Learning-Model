This is my Comment Toxicity Detection Machine Learning Model.

This project uses TensorFlow, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and MatPlotLib.

**Why I created this model:**
The reason I created this model is because traditionally, comments are filtered out
using blacklists. This works the majority of the time but fails to capture
comments that circumvent that system by using words that aren't blacklisted but are still toxic.
Most of the time words containing vulgarity are blacklisted. Toxic comments that don't contain vulgarity would get
passed the traditional blacklist method.
